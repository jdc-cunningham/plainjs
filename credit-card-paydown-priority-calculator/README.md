# Credit Card Paydown Priority Calculator

## Concept
This is pretty basic how it works, it takes the incrementer and uses that as a divisor multiplied by 2. <br />
So it produces a reducing decimal that is multiplied against an income(what a person can pay) <br />
The first card gets the most, it's decimal value is 1 - sum(post decimals)

## Interface
The interface is a basic left/right. It will store to user's local storage with a way to clear the data store for this app

## Additiona info
I'm going to try using plain JS for this, OOP and functional, not sure if you can mix those things together offhand.
