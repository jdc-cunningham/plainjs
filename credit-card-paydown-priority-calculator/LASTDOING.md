Plan is to trigger calculations on keyup in new amount field <br />
Issue at the moment is float check passes with example 1.2b <br />
After this, will trigger re-render of cards but this time a new property <br />
will be available which is a second value(pay amount) that will show up on right <br />
side of balance. Will add color differentiation
